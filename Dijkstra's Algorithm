 # GRAPH DATA STRUCTURES.
* It is a non Linear DSA consisting of Nodes/Vertices and Edges.
* A tree is subset of a graph.
* The main types of graphs are: Undirected graph(Bidirectional Flow), Directed Gragh(Unidirectional Flow).

** Dijkstras Algorithm.**
* Approach One.
* Choosing the Shortest Path based on the Distance Lables of the Nodes.
* Choice comes upon the Shortest Path.
* First Value Boxed with a Zero(0)
* Boxing the Values that are having the smallest Values.
* If the computation of the new distance is Bigger than the Previos smaller, Discarded.

# Approach Two.
* Matrix approach.
* If there is no direct Connection use Infinity.
*
