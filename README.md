# REPOSITOTY DATA.
* This Repository is mainly exploring all the possible Data structures Ideas. 
* They can range from Sorting Algorithms, Searching Algorithms.
* It also takes into consideration the various structures such as Linked Lists , 
* Arrays and Many more others.


# HASHING TECHNIQUE.
* Collision is when Two Keys result to the Same Values..
* Linear Probing is used to Solve collision.
* Or a Linked List can be created.

* # Examples.
* Values: 1,2,42,4,12,14,17,13,37.
            **Hash Function=2key+3**
** Keys**   **Hash=2k+3 % 20** // The 20 is the Table Size.
# Lets consider Linear Probing.

# SECURITY MEASURES.
* It is important to Keep the Table Size Secrete.
* It is important to keep the Hash Function a Secrete.

# Separate Chaining.
  * if a collision occurs, a new node is generated.
